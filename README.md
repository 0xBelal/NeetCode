# NeetCode Roadmap [ https://neetcode.io/roadmap ]

I am currently working on solving the problems in the **NeetCode Roadmap**, which covers essential topics for competitive programming and technical interviews. This is my plan to improve my skills and prepare for interviews and coding contests.

## What I'm Solving:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, Graph Algorithms, and more.
- **Advanced Topics**: String Matching, Number Theory, Segment Trees, Binary Indexed Trees.

## Goal:
- Solve problems and implement algorithms and data structures efficiently.
- Sharpen skills for technical interviews and competitive programming contests.

## Progress:
- I will regularly update this repo with the problems I've solved and their solutions.
